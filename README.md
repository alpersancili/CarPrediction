# 🚗 Car Price Prediction Application
This project is a machine learning-based web application that predicts the price of used cars based on various features such as make, model, mileage, and more. The application is built using Python, and the model is deployed using Streamlit for an interactive web interface.

🔧 Project Overview
Key Features:
Predict Car Prices: Users can input various car features to get an estimated price for a used car.
Data Preprocessing: The data is preprocessed using scaling for numerical features and one-hot encoding for categorical features.
Machine Learning Model: A Linear Regression model is used to predict car prices.
Web Deployment: The application is deployed using Streamlit, providing a user-friendly interface.
🗂️ Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains the following features:

Make: The brand of the car (e.g., Ford, Toyota).
Model: The specific model of the car (e.g., Mustang, Camry).
Trim: The version of the model (e.g., GT, XLE).
Mileage: The total distance the car has traveled.
Type: The type of car (e.g., Sedan, SUV).
Cylinder: The number of cylinders in the car's engine.
Liter: The engine size in liters.
Doors: The number of doors on the car.
Cruise, Sound, Leather: Boolean features indicating if the car has cruise control, a premium sound system, and leather seats, respectively.
🚀 Model
Preprocessing:
Numerical Features: Standard scaling is applied to normalize features like Mileage, Cylinder, Liter, and Doors.
Categorical Features: One-hot encoding is used for categorical variables like Make, Model, Trim, and Type.
Model Training:
A Linear Regression model is used for prediction.
The data is split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
Performance Metrics:
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Provides a measure of the difference between predicted and actual values.
R-Squared (R2): Indicates how well the model explains the variance in the data.
🌐 Web Application
The web app is built using Streamlit. Users can input the following features to predict the car price:

Make, Model, Trim
Mileage, Type
Cylinder, Liter
Doors
Cruise, Sound, Leather
Once the inputs are provided, the app predicts and displays the car price.

🛠️ Future Improvements
Model Enhancement: Experiment with other models like Random Forest or XGBoost for better accuracy.
Feature Engineering: Add more features like car age or fuel type to improve predictions.
User Interface: Enhance the UI with more interactive features.
